equlilbrium line not on the glacier

equilibrium lines and mass balances are the same within their uncertainties


comparison with mass balance group data

our data could be more precise than measurements of single years, because statistical fluctuations of single years have less influence



higher ablation at T6 and T8: Due to local environment (mountains, inclination, wind, sun...)
