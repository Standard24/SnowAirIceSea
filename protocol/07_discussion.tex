\subsection{Horizontal velocity}

we expect an eastwards velocity on Tellbreen

westwards on Blekumbreen, not to much variation of speed over glacier

most velocities are not different from 0
-> this is why we do not calculate ice flux


sources of uncertainty:
gps position,
stake inclination and direction are hard to measure,
example: 10 deg inclination, 2m ablation...

different process of last years groups:


compare with theoretical values

horizontal comparison of tab. 1.3


single stakes:

BL5:
outlier?


-> directions from plots


blekumbreen better than tellbreen?

compare to older reports

\subsection{Vertical velocity}


equlilbrium line not on the glacier

equilibrium lines and mass balances are the same within their uncertainties on the two glaciers


comparison with mass balance group data

our data could be more precise than measurements of single years, because statistical fluctuations of single years have less influence


higher ablation at T6 and T8: Due to local environment (mountains, inclination, wind, sun...)
