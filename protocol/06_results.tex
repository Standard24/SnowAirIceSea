    \label{GPS:fig:stakepos}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{GPS:fig:stakepos} shows the positions of the currently 12 different stake locations
on Blekumbreen and Tellbreen.
At those locations, a total of 26 measurements has been performed in 2018.
Additionally, all available data of the stake positions since 2009 is shown on the figure.\\
The coarse resolution of the figure shows a rough accordance of all of this year's positions with the values 
of the last years.
The stakes spread over about 5 kilometers in east-west direction and 1.5 kilometers in north-south direction.

Figure~\ref{GPS:fig:T1_2d} shows all available data for one single stake (T1) in a higher resolution.\\
The measurement of the location of T1-2017 (green) has been performed two times
(Figs.~\ref{GPS:fig:T1-i_timeseries} and \ref{GPS:fig:T1-ii_timeseries})
in order to estimate the uncertainty
of the position.
The two positions differ by 19\,cm and match within their uncertainties.

Equation~\ref{GPS:eq:v} gives the relation how the ice velocity $v_{year}$ has been calculated from the corrected stake positions in
Tab.~\ref{GPS:tab:os_tab}:
The distance between this year's position and the position measured in 2017, 2016 or 2015 has been divided
by the passed time $t$ (1, 2 or 3 years).
$N_{year}$ and $E_{year}$ are the northing and easting of the year which has been used to calculate the distance to
this year's position.
The positions of this year ($N_{year, 2018}$ and $E_{year, 2018}$) have been shifted by the respective distance
$\Delta_{\text{ref}, year}$ that ablation has
added to inclined stakes since the year $year$, as described in section~\ref{GPS:sec:Processing}.
Equation~\ref{GPS:eq:sv} shows how the error on $v_{year}$ has been obtained.
For the uncertainties on the past year's values ($\delta_{N_{year}}^2$ and $\delta_{E_{year}}^2$),
the mean uncertainties $\overline{\delta_{\text{N}}}$ and $\overline{\delta_{\text{E}}}$ of this year's values
from Tab~\ref{GPS:tab:errors} have been used.

Table~\ref{GPS:tab:vel_tab} lists the calculated velocities for all stakes.
The direction of the movements can be seen on the detailed figures for each stake in the appendix.

\subsection{Vertical velocity (mass balance)} \label{GPS:subsec:maba}

Besides the horizontal position, the GPS data also contain elevation.
An analysis of the change of elevation (the vertical velocity) of the stakes over the past years offers the possibility to determine the individual average mass balances.\\
We have been able to find elevation data from former groups for the last 7 years,
back until 2011.
Figures~\ref{GPS:fig:elev_ble} and \ref{GPS:fig:elev_tel} show this data,
together with the new data from 2018.
For most of the old data points, the uncertainties are not known.
Therefore there are no error bars shown on the plots.

Apart from a couple of outliers, the elevation of all stakes decreases quite linearly.
Therefore linear fits of the elevation have been performed for all stakes individually.
The results of the fits are shown in Tables~\ref{GPS:tab:mbal_ble} and \ref{GPS:tab:mbal_tel}.\\
With the individual mass balances for each stake,
it is possible to calculate the mass balance gradients and the equilibrium line elevations of the two glaciers.
This is shown in Figs.~\ref{GPS:fig:elev_ble_mbg} and \ref{GPS:fig:elev_tel_mbg}.
The values on the y-axis (stake elevation) are mean values of all elevation measurements of the different years.

The linear fits yield the following results for the equilibrium lines (EL) and mass balance gradients~(MBG) on Blekumbreen and Tellbreen:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\text{EL}_\text{B} = 751 \pm 45\, \text{m} \qquad \text{MBG}_\text{B} = 5.1 \pm 1.0\, \text{mm/m}\\
\text{EL}_\text{T} = 757 \pm 56\, \text{m} \qquad \text{MBG}_\text{T} = 6.8 \pm 1.4\, \text{mm/m}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Theoretical surface velocity}
% Different tables for different values of B(T = 0,-5,-10,-15), \alpha = 5,6,7 and H (from the ice-radar scans) = 1 (minimal value â€” minimum was at 3), 33.4 (average value), 82,3 (maximum)
Based on the shallow ice approximation is is possible to calculate a theoretical surface velocity for the glaciers we did our measurements on.
To make the calculation (see \ref{GPS:eq:sia}) the variables slope angle, ice velocity and ice thickness has to be chosen. 
The ice density is assumed as 917 kg/m$^3$ and the gravitational acceleration as 9.81  m/s$^2$.
The values for the ice viscosity are displayed in table \ref{GPS:tab:iceviscosities}.
It is not possible to determine the exact ice temperature.
Because of this, the calculation is done for viscosities for different ice temperatures $T$.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Temperature [$^\circ$C] & 0 & -5 & -10 & -15 \\
\midrule
Ice viscosity $\left[ P / \text{a}^{-3} \right]$ & $5,52 \cdot 10^7$ & $8,63 \cdot 10^7$ & $1.28 \cdot 10^8$ & $1.52 \cdot 10^8$\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Ice viscosities for different ice temperatures $T = \{0,-5,-10,-15\}$}
\label{GPS:tab:iceviscosities}
\end{table}

The theoretical velocity is mainly influenced by the ice thickness (see tables \ref{GPS:tab:theorytable5}, \ref{GPS:tab:theorytable6} and \ref{GPS:tab:theorytable7} ).
For the mean thickness the theoretical surface velocity of ice has the order of magnitude of centimeters. 
The small velocity value corresponds with the measured velocities (compare \ref{GPS:tab:vel_tab}).

The theoetical calculation can be applied on the different stake locations.
The surface velocity for the ice temperature of -5$^\circ$C and -10$^\circ$C are comparable results to the measurement values (see table \ref{GPS:tab:stakesvelocities}).
Also the theoretical calculated mass balance confirm with overall negative values that both glaciers are completly in the ablation zone (see subsec. \ref{GPS:subsec:maba}).
